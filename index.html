        <p class="title"> Software Engineering Student </p>
        <p>For those who don't know me my name is Cooper Warner and am currently working very hard to graduate from Western university
        with a software engineering degree. I am a student who is very hard-working, loyal, adaptable and commited to whatever task I have on hand. Some of my

  <h1> My Work Expeience </h1> 
 </div>

 <div>
  <h2> Telemarketing </h2>
  <p1> For a short time in highschool I worked at a telemarketing agency making cold calls to try and book appointments to clean windows. This was
 the first ever time I had been employed and it was a great way to build essential marketing skills that relate to customer service, persuasiveness and telephone
 communication. </p1>
   </div>

 <div>
  <h2> Lifeguarding </h2>
  <p1> Throughout the later parts of highschool I became employed for a local community centre working their as a lifeguard. I worked at this job for a lot
  longer and working here required me to have a lot more responsibility as I am responsible for people's safety. It was for this postion that required me to get
  all my first aid training and it helped me to acheive many of the physical skills I have today</p1>
 </div>

 <div>
  <h2> Swim-Instructor/Camp Counsillor </h2>
  <p1> During my summers I spend my time working at summer camp where I am a swim instructor along with a counsillor. Both these jobs require me to look
  after and teach 10-20 children all by myself. This allowed me to build very good leadership and creativity skills and I am still working here to this day.</p1>
