    <h3> Telemarketing </h3>
    <p> For a short time in highschool I worked at a telemarketing agency making cold calls to try and book appointments to clean windows. This was
 the first ever time I had been employed and it was a great way to build essential marketing skills that relate to customer service, persuasiveness and telephone
 communication.</p>

    <h3> Lifeguarding </h3>
    <p> Throughout the later parts of highschool I became employed for a local community centre working their as a lifeguard. I worked at this job for a lot
  longer and working here required me to have a lot more responsibility as I am responsible for people's safety. It was for this postion that required me to get
  all my first aid training and it helped me to acheive many of the physical skills I have today.</p>

    <h3> Swim Instructor/Counsillor </h3>
    <p> During my summers I spend my time working at summer camp where I am a swim instructor along with a counsillor. Both these jobs require me to look
  after and teach 10-20 children all by myself. This allowed me to build very good leadership and creativity skills and I am still working here to this day.</p>
