        <h2>Cooper Warner</h2>
        <p class="title"> Software Engineering Student </p>
        <p>For those who don't know me my name is Cooper Warner and am currently working very hard to graduate from Western university
        with a software engineering degree. I am a student who is very hard-working, loyal, adaptable and commited to whatever task I have on hand. Some of my 
        skills are ability to work with code, problem-solving, cooperating and working with a team and I am also highly trained in first aid. I spend a lot of my
        personal time going to the gym, reading and spending time with my friends. My goals in the future are to finish this program and the proceed to get 
        my MBa. </p>
